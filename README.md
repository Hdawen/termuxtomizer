# TermuXtomizer - Termux Customizer

## Freatures
- Z shell
- Oh My Zsh
- Plugins (auto suggestions, completions, syntax highlighting)
- Powerlevel10k
- Up to 35 fonts
- Up to 136 custom color schemes
- Double-lined hot keys
- Neofetch on startup (Optional)

## Install
```bash
curl -OL https://raw.github.com/mechtifs/termuxtomizer/master/config.sh
chmod +x config.sh
./config.sh
```

## Uninstall
```bash
./config.sh -r
```

## Tips
- **Run `./config.sh -r` before reinstalling is required.**
- Select **"no"** when Powerlevel10k asks you to change the font.
- "Neofetch on startup" may highly affect the startup process, so by default it's not enabled. However, you could try "instant prompt" featured in Powerlevel10k to gain a better experience with "neofetch on startup" enabled.

## Todos
- Optimize the script
- Colored output
